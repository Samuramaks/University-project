# University-project
This repository was created for uploading my projects from the university 
A description of my projects will be presented here.
<h3>CourseWork</h3>
This project is my CourseWork, in which you can find out how well and quickly you type the words shown to you on the screen in a minute. Then you can look on the diagram for the percentage of words you have written correctly for every 10 seconds. 

<h3>Site</h3>
<br>
I wrote a simple site using html, css, php. This site was intended for viewing driving schools, their locations, contacts, registration for a trial lesson, as well as databases for viewing registered users and for viewing who and which driving school signed up for a trial lesson.
